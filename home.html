        <h2>My Journey at KSU</h2>
        <p>I transferred to Kennesaw State University for the start of my junior year, Fall 2023. I had just finished a rather rough semester at Georgia State University. I had just switched from being a Computer Science major to Information Technology.</p>
        <p>It was a very difficult transition, but I was able to make the most of it. I was able to meet a lot of new people, and I was able to learn a lot of new things, that have helped me tremendously, and I am very grateful for the time, effort, and attention given to students at Kennesaw State University.
